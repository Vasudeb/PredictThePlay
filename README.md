# PredictThePlay

PredictThePlay is a next-generation cricket fan experience platform designed to make match watching more immersive. Instead of only seeing the score — fans get to engage with every ball, predict outcomes, compete with the community, and visually understand momentum.

This prototype demonstrates the product experience layer of ball-by-ball prediction, match landing pages, and fan interaction flows.
